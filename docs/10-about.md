About
=====

Phundament is a Web Application Foundation built upon PHP and Yii Framework 2.0, best for rapidly developing web
applications. It follows the [12factor specifications](http://12factor.net) on a very slim codebase.

The goal of Phundament is to provide a rock-solid base for integrating the best tools and plugins for web-application development, 
while not creating a new framework or [another competing standard](http://xkcd.com/927/). Instead, existing tools are pre-configured in a clean and
easy way.

Compared to the `yii2-app-advanced` and `yii2-app-basic` Phundament introduces a configuration based on environment variables,
which gives you a maximum of control over your application setup.
